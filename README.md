# transfer_learning
Tool for deep learning image classification using state-of-the-art pre-trained models and benchmark datasets. The results will be thoroughly explored with LIME explanations and the visualisations of convolutional features.  

This tool allows user to work with benchmark datasets and 
It's fully automated with outputs such as:
- loss plots
- accuracy plots
- confusion matrix
- model architecture
- grid of images with predicted labels
- visualisation of convolutional features
- LIME model 

This tool is built to educate and help understanding deep learning with Pytorch along with
architectures of benchmark netwoks designed for vision related tasks and eperimentation with 
visualising convolutional features and super pixels.
 
I hope it proves to be useful in the community, in particular to newbees in Deep Learning and Pytorch.
Feel free to fork, suggest changes and build additional functionality.
